# Neighborhood Map


This is my 7th project in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

The goal of this project is:
- Learn to use `knockout.js`.
- Learn to use `APIs`.
- The final result is a map of popular places around Dubai, they are marked and when the markers are clicked, a wikipedia link and street view will be displayed.
